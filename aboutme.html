                        <p>My hobbies include self-studying web development through tutorials and step by step guides, I like to set a weekly goal on a topic 
                            I want to further my knowledge about and use my time wisely to progress rather than just watching tv and switching off type thing after work.<br><br>
                            I also enjoy working on my own business in my spare time, I started my cosmetic business by watching how I set up a shop with Shopify YouTube tutorials, 
                            I then took this knowledge and created my own business from branding and marketing it all myself. I bought and designed all my products, 
                            designed my own logo and website, bought a camera and light box for professional images for the website and social media for marketing.<br><br>
                            I have marketed my company on social media, Instagram being one of the most vital ones as visionary plays a huge roll in sales.<br>
                            I do everything from my expenses and taking orders, posting and stock. I have also written some of the code for my website myself like margins, padding, 
                            Hex code colours.<br><br>
                                I have been asked why haven’t I put all my time and effort getting this off the ground and doing this full time and I did, 
                                I worked self-employed for 18 months on and off making a great wage/profit and it was not where my passion was, 
                                I also found it quite lonely at times as I was the only person running the show and I was not in verbal communication at all with customers as 
                                it was all done over Shopify and I know web development is what I want to do as a career hence me still continuing even with many setbacks 
                                including redundancy and wrong job placements during the apprenticeship.
                                <br><br>
                                I also Skateboard and have been doing so for 10 years, I help out at girl’s skate night in Manchester after work on how to skateboard, I travel around England to different skate parks when I have the time and love meeting new people through it. I have also done things like filming for Disney and modelling for sports companies through skateboarding so that has been a fun journey over the years.
