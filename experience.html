                        <p>
                            At DXC, my role as Senior Assistant system technician is to gather data for British Aerospace on systems that DXC supply (BAe) 
                            and place it into graphs to display the findings for them to see weekly what is going well or not throughout different applications.<br>
                            I have also been looking at automating one of the systems, so someone doesn’t have to man that part of the system anymore and
                             it will run itself. I left this apprenticeship placement and moved to GovNet because they did not do any software or 
                             web development what so ever and i wanted to persue a carrer web development.<br><br>

                                    My Job role in the software development department was to build emails for clients using HTML and CSS.<br>
                                     I would start off by using a Photoshop document in which the email is to be modelled off exactly, such as size and colours 
                                     when building it with HTML and CSS, I would write HTML code from scratch, starting at the top of the email and building it 
                                     all the way down to the footer, perfecting each section and making sure every spacer and image was the 
                                     exact same as the Photoshop design. <br><br>Once the email was built and working perfectly for desktop, I had to then make the 
                                     code responsive for mobile use which is half the size of the desktop width when opening the email, building the mobile 
                                     code alongside the desktop code so no matter what device the email is opened on it still looks structurally the same.
                                    Using CSS to build and style the mobile version, mobile is half the size of desktop, some photographs from the desktop 
                                    design wouldn't be able to fit now on the mobile size, so CSS is used to hide photographs or to stack them on top of one another 
                                    to still match the email design even when it is half the size for mobile use. This is perfect when you need to swap images from 
                                    a 350px logo to a 175px of the same logo but for the mobile version.<br><br>
                                    Once the desktop and mobile version of the email are built and working perfectly, they are then tested, 
                                    this is done by pasting your code into a software which runs it and sends you back an image of what your code 
                                    looks like on emails such as Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo,  usually 70 different email versions to check over to make sure 
                                    your code displays exactly as it should. If an image is pushing out or structured where it shouldn't on say Outlook, 
                                    I would have to go back into my code and rewrite it a different way, so it stays structure as it should and displays as 
                                    it should on all 70 different email types.
